# Block Hack Hackathon

Solidity contract for verifiable charity. 
Idea: Create partnership with charities/institutions, verify their address through a smart contract.
Those charities/institutions can then verify addresses of the homeless. Donors would see verfied profiles on our DAPP and send their donations via UCash. 

## Structure
This repo has solidity contracts and very minimal front end to be loaded on to a proper framework.
